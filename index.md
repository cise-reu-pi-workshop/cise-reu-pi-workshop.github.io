description: Bringing together REU site leaders to share best practices and foster collaboration.
---

The National Science Foundation's Division of Computer and Information Science Engineering supports undergraduate research through its Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program. The program funds REU sites that host annual cohorts of undergraduates doing research at institutions across the United States.

The leaders (PIs) of these REU sites are invited to a workshop in Pittsburgh, PA on April 21â€“23, 2025. The workshop brings together REU PIs to build community and exchange effective practices for engaging undergraduate students in cutting-edge research and meaningful research experiences.

The workshop was made possible with support from [National Science Foundation Award #2407231](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2407231&HistoricalAwards=false).
